Tables And Keys...
	>> Primary Key: an attribute which uniquely defines the row in the DB. eg(id).
		Surrogate Key: a key that has no mapping or purpose to anything in the real world.
		Natural Key: a key that has a mapping or purpose in the real world.
		Foreign Key: an attribute that can be stored on a db table that will link us to another db table.
